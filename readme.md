neurron
=======

> A web based multiplayer game which is displayed on a common screen and controlled by smartphones. The players are running through a tunnel and have to avoid emerging obstacles.

neurron is our entry for the Coding Workshow at the HTW (winter 2013). We wanted to create a fast paced game, using different technologies on front- and backend. Our server is written in C++, while the client is created with HTMl, CSS & JavaScript.
